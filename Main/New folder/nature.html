            Landscape Photography
          </div>
          <p>Have you ever been out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nature, without a single person around? It’s a crazy feeling. You can look around the world, and you feel like you’re a part of it — and that is landscape photography.</p>
          <p> photography is capturing an image that embodies the spirit of the outdoors. It carries a sense of being there to see something incredible. When viewers look at your work, their hearts should jump. You want them to feel the same emotions that you felt, standing in the middle of nature and bringing back something amazing.</p>

            Wildlife Photography
          </div>
            <p>Wildlife photography is a loosely-defined profession which demands a passion for nature and art. Wildlife photographers make a career of traveling to remote areas and taking pictures of wild animals and natural scenery.</p>
            <p>Wildlife photography began as a hobby of safari hunters, in the early 1900s, who found photographs to be less violent and more permanent reminders of their adventures than the slaying and stuffing of a wild animal. Modern photographers often began as artists, biologists, or park rangers, and taught themselves the technical aspects of the field.</p>
            <p>Classes in wildlife photography are offered at colleges and art schools around the world, and many organized safaris and expeditions also provide training and photographic opportunities. Wildlife photographs can be sold to greeting card companies, printed as posters, sold as stock photography, collected into a book, displayed in an art gallery, or sold to a magazine. Additionally, some wildlife photographers are hired full-time by nature magazines.</p>
            <p>Wildlife photography is a demanding and competitive vocation. Traveling to isolated areas is expensive, as is the photographic equipment necessary for professional quality photos. The work itself is physically and mentally taxing, requiring patience and perfectionism. Because wild animals are wary of humans, wildlife photographers must use a hide to get close enough for a clear photograph. Hides are made of anything that conceals form and movement, such as a tiny tent with an opening for the camera, or a car with tinted windows.</p>
            <p>Even with a hide, the photographer may have only several seconds in which to take the photo, due to the unpredictability of wild animals, making agility and patience necessary traits. Persistence is also useful. Obtaining special permission to visit national parks in restricted regions or after hours is often essential, although it can be very difficult to accomplish. In addition, the photographer must research the photographic site to understand local lighting conditions, weather, the habits of local</p>
            <p>wildlife, and the customs of local peoples. Only the best wildlife photographers earn enough money to support themselves entirely with their photographs.</p>

            Macro Photography
          </div>
          <p>A great part of nature photography and even scientific research, macro photography provides a vast learning field for photographers and a chance for the viewers to discover the tiny world around us. For both the author and the public, macro represents an absorbing activity, which has us delving into a whole universe that is not visible to the naked eye, capturing it and bringing it back on a larger scale for us to observe and be in awe of. Whether it’s small insects, mineral specimens or miniature plants, the macro method allows us to see even the tiniest detail and texture[1]. This is what essentially differentiates it from close-up photography, which uses different kinds of lenses and techniques. Through macro photography, we can see as much as the hairs on an insect’s face or the pattern in its eye, sometimes for the sake of biology, sometimes as documentation and sometimes fascinating, even abstract, forms of art. These shots can be taken inside the studio or outdoors, where photographers can spend hours in search for the perfect subject and shot. This genre is the perfect example of when the camera encourages us not just to capture what we see, but to also really look around us.</p>
